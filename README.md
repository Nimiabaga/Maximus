# Maximus — Static Menu Website

A simple, static website for a bar & restaurant menu. Built with plain HTML and a shared CSS file. Easy to edit, easy to host on GitHub Pages.

## Where things live

* HTML pages sit in the project root (e.g., `index.html`, `beer.html`).
* Global styles are in `style.css`.
* All images (logo and menu photos) go in the `images/` folder.

## How to edit

* Update menu items directly in the relevant HTML page.
* Change item names or descriptions by editing the text in the card.
* Swap photos by replacing image files in `images/` and updating the filename in the page if needed.
* Use descriptive alternative text on images for accessibility.

## Branding

* Replace `images/logo.png` with the new logo (same filename keeps links intact).
* Find and replace the site name across pages (e.g., change any previous brand name to **Maximus**).
* Update phone numbers, address, WhatsApp link, and map on the Contact page.

## Navigation

* Each page has a bottom navigation bar. Mark the current page as “active” so it highlights correctly.

## Images

* Keep images reasonably small for fast loading (around 800–1200 px wide is a good target).
* Prefer JPG for photos and consistent aspect ratios to keep the grid tidy.

## Preview locally

* Open `index.html` in your browser.
* Any basic static server works if you prefer a local server (optional).

## Deploy on GitHub Pages

1. Push the project to GitHub.
2. In the repository, go to **Settings → Pages**.
3. Under **Build and deployment**, choose **Deploy from a branch**.
4. Select the `main` branch and the root directory, then save.
5. Your site will appear at `https://<your-username>.github.io/Maximus/`.

## Troubleshooting

* If an image doesn’t show, confirm the filename and that it’s inside `images/`.
* If the active nav highlight looks wrong, ensure only the current page is marked active.
* If page content sits under the bottom bar, keep some bottom padding in the main content.
